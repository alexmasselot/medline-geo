##Where are the scientific publications coming from? Localizing Medline citations.

Where are the scientific publications coming from throughout the years? Which country is collaborating with which? What are the hottest topics of the year? To investigate those questions, we focused on Medline, the major biology and biomedical peer reviewed citation repository.

Here is a two part projects to browse through Medline citations, their geographical locations, country production and collaborations.
Head to http://blog.octo.com/QQQ for a lengthy discussion on the matter or dive in the `compoenents/` directory to launch the back and frontend applications.

To build the full application as a single one, simply install `docker` and bunild/run it!
